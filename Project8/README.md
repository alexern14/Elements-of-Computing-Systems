Time spent on project: 8 hours

To build:
- simply run `./Build.sh` from the main directory
    - this build the project using cmake
    - the executbale `VMtranslator` should now be in the main directory

- To run the executbale:
    - `./VMtranslator <input-file/directory>`

Tests that I got to pass:
- BasicLoop
- FibonacciSeries

None of the FunctionCall tests passed, but some were close when looking at the .out vs the .cmp files
